# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a variety of plots using the `matplotlib` library in Python. We use real-world datasets to illustrate different types of visualizations:

1. **Line Graph**: Trends in gas prices over time across different countries.
2. **Histogram**: Distribution of player skills in FIFA 2018.
3. **Pie Chart**: Preferred foot of FIFA players.
4. **Box Plot**: Comparison of player ratings across professional soccer teams.

These examples showcase how to effectively visualize and interpret data using `matplotlib`.

Feel free to explore the code and datasets to see these visualizations in action!
